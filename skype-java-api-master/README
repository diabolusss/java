This project is a mavenization and release of Skype4Java with several bug fixes.

* 1.4 RELEASED

Several bugfixes and a few features have been added to this version. 

- Windows : 
	- now the native library can be compiled using mingw, both under windows and linux. It is still possible to 
compile using visual studio, but mingw compilation is preferred.
	- a small bug in getInstaledPath function has been fixed.
	- fixed native library extraction and loading

- Mac OS : 
	- fixed problems with getProfile and other functions that depended on deprecated MESSAGE object have been fixed.
	- framework extraction fixed to work both from jar and eclipse

- Linux : a major rewrite has been done. There are now two native implementations, the old one using X11 and a new one
	using DBUS. The X11 version was very unstable and could even connect to a skype instance running on another user.
	The default implementation is now DBUS, which prove much more stable on my tests. It is possible to use the old
	implementation setting a system variable: "skype.api.impl" to x11

Some new features have been added:

- Chat.setGuidelines : can be used to change a set guidelines
- Chat.addListener : allows registering a listener that will be triggered for users entering and leaving a chat
- Skype.addChatEditListener : allows adding a listener that will be triggered when messages are edited

Besides, the samples have been moved to its own project and a lot of refactorings have been to done to organize
the code.
