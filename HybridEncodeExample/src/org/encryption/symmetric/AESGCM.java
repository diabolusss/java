/**
 * GCM is an Authenticated Encryption mode. 
 * It provides you with confidentiality (encryption), integrity, and authentication (MAC) in one go.
 * 
 * Padding: by default, Java uses PKCS#7 padding. That works, but it is often vulnerable 
 *  to padding oracle attacks which are best defeated with a MAC. 
 * 
 *  * GCM embeds already a MAC (called GMAC).
 * 
 * Having said that, one must be aware that GCM security relies on a good random 
 * number generation for creation of the IV.
 * 
 * Because reusing an nonce/key combination destroys the security guarantees of AES-GCM mode, 
 * it can be difficult to use this mode securely when using statically configured keys. 
 * For safety's sake, implementations MUST use an automated key management system, 
 * such as the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) [RFC2409], to ensure that this requirement is met.

     *  protecting the data encrypted with the AES key.

     * Important  
     *  Keys used for wrapping should always be at least as secure, 
     *  if not more so, than the key being protected.
