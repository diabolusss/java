3. Open an issue with:
  * Device and app information
    * What's your device?
    * What Android version is it running?
    * What version and build ID of SMSSecure do you have?
  * Upstream bug (if any)
  * App state
    * What are the relevant preferences that you have set that may be related to the issue?
  * Raw debug info
    * A debug log (Settings → Advanced → Submit debug log, or `adb logcat | grep $(adb shell ps | grep org.smssecure.smssecure | cut -c10-15)`). If your debug log contains sensitive data, you can send it at support@smssecure.org.
    * (Optional) Screenshots (`adb shell /system/bin/screencap -p /sdcard/screencap.png && adb pull /sdcard/screencap.png`) or video.
