# SMSSecure [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SMSSecure/SMSSecure.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SMSSecure/SMSSecure)

[SMSSecure](https://smssecure.org) is an SMS/MMS application that allows you to protect your privacy while communicating with friends.

Using SMSSecure, you can send SMS messages and share media or attachments with complete privacy.

Features:
* Easy. SMSSecure works like any other SMS application. There's nothing to sign up for and no new service your friends need to join.
* Reliable. SMSSecure communicates using encrypted SMS messages. No servers or internet connection required.
* Private. SMSSecure uses the TextSecure encryption protocol to provide privacy for every message, every time.
* Safe. All messages are encrypted locally, so if your phone is lost or stolen, your messages are protected.
* Open Source. SMSSecure is Free and Open Source, enabling anyone to verify its security by auditing the code.


## Project goals

This is a fork of [TextSecure](https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure) that aims to keep the SMS encryption that TextSecure removed [for a variety of reasons](https://whispersystems.org/blog/goodbye-encrypted-sms/).

SMSSecure focuses on SMS and MMS. This fork aims to:

* Keep SMS/MMS encryption
* Drop Google services dependencies (push messages are not available in SMSSecure)
* Integrate upstream bugfixes and patches from TextSecure

## Migrating from TextSecure to SMSSecure

* In TextSecure, export a plaintext backup. Warning: the backup will **not** be encrypted.
* Install SMSSecure.
* In SMSSecure, import the plaintext backup (this will import the TextSecure backup if no SMSSecure backup is found).
* If TextSecure v2.6.4 or earlier is installed, update or uninstall it so it doesn't conflict (can cause errors with key exchanges).
* Enjoy SMSSecure!

Note: You will have to start new secured sessions with your contacts.
